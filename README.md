# Crime_Data_Analysis_and_Visualization_Project

Crime Data Analysis and Visualization with Predictive Modeling‚Äù aims to develop an interactive platform that enables users to analyze historical crime data, visualize trends, predict future crime occurrences, and identify safer travel routes based on crime density. By leveraging Python and libraries like Pandas, Plotly, Folium, and Scikit-learn, the system processes open-source crime datasets, performs exploratory data analysis, and builds a Random Forest regression model to forecast crime rates in specific locations. Interactive charts and heatmaps help users explore crime patterns by location, type, and time, while the route suggestion feature overlays crime data on maps to guide users through safer paths. The project addresses key challenges such as data inconsistency, predictive accuracy, and real-time integration while offering practical applications for law enforcement agencies and public safety tools. Ultimately, it empowers both authorities and individuals with data-driven insights to enhance awareness and make informed safety decisions.
